Several state-of-the-art algorithms are embedded in our framework for implementing the given matrix M and the recovered matrix M', for instance, Paar1, RPaar1 (the randomised version of Paar1), BP, BFI (Banik et al.'s method), RNBP, A1, A2;
We adopt several openly available implementations for these heuristics:

1. Paar1、BP: Use the implementations from: https://github.com/rub-hgi/shorter_linear_slps_for_mds_matrices;
2. RPaar1: RPaar1 takes a candidate with equal possibility, is implemented by a slight tweaking of Paar1;
3. BFI: In order to implement BFI algorithm, we generate two permutation matrices randomly and use them as Banik et al. did;
4. RNBP、A1、A2: Adopted from Tan and Peyrin's implementation which can be found: https://github.com/thomaspeyrin/XORreduce.

The code can be run with a single thread or multithreading;
The variable "MULTI_THREAD_FLAG" in the file const.h indicates whether multithreading is used:
  MULTI_THREAD_FLAG = 0 : single thread;\
  MULTI_THREAD_FLAG = 1 : multithreading.

To run this program, an example command will be:
        g++ *.h
        g++ *.cpp -o test.out -lpthread
        ./test.out <./test_matrix.txt    

An example of an input matrix will be:
